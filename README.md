# Hi, I'm Waldo Ketonou  
### Business & Data Analyst | SQL • Python • R • Tableau | Turning Operations Into Insights

I’m a Business & Data Analyst with 18+ years of experience leading high‑volume operations and transforming complex business problems into clear, actionable insights. After nearly two decades managing multimillion‑dollar retail operations, I transitioned into analytics to formalize the work I’ve always loved: building KPIs, analyzing performance trends, optimizing processes, and using data to drive better decisions.

I bring a hybrid skillset that blends:
- **Technical analytics** (SQL, Python, R, Tableau, Excel,Google Sheets)
- **Business operations expertise** (KPIs, forecasting, budgeting, process optimization)
- **Data storytelling** for non‑technical stakeholders

I’m currently building a portfolio of dashboards and case studies through **WaldoSphere Group LLC**, where I help small businesses uncover insights that improve efficiency, profitability, and decision‑making.
